hello world

1. the unique point on a graph via its input set is used to create a regression model from scratch
2. model points can all be represented on a single axis' (transforming lines into single unique points can be done algorithmically at chosen INTERVALS) ex: video model second model

REGRESSION MODEL 
question: a model to tell if a basketball is in a picture
transforming line: no
example: picture 
parameters: pixel_location, pixel_color
algorithm: pixel_location * pixel_color + ...n

REGRESSION MODEL
question: a model to tell if a basketball goes trough a hoop (must observe how many points are necessary to observe correct video)
line duration transformed: 18 y points... one point representing a millisecond
tansforming line: yes  ...transofrm 18 point lines into one point, defined uniquely (the beginning and end of the interval can be sed numerically to define uniqueness)
example: video
parameters: pixel_location, pixel_color
algorithm: pixel_location * pixel_color + ...n

every 18 points, transform the line into a single point

make sure to label the points with large zoom conferences 

this point seems to be for basketballs

(or do the algorithm of your choice and compare that way)

done
