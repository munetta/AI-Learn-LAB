Algorithm   1
 _______   
   -name: pixel (edge/whole) distance relativety algorithm
   -purpose: gets the most accurate label of a picture
   -description: takes the slope between all points in a unique grid square image representing a picture
   -complexity: n^2 on incoming target

Algorithm 2
 _______ 
   -name: (edge/whole) matching algorithm
   -purpose: gets the most accurate label of a picture
   -description: takes the minimum distance between two same size arrays. Starts search at a certain matched amount
   -complexity: n
