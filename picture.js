this is a picture model written in javascript. there are three versions. one with a line. one with a point. one with a line converted to a point. all displayed.

  order 
  1. point 
  2. line 
  3. line to point 

  proof 
  can lines be converted back to points affectively (uniquely)?
  assumption: yes

  1. point

  let graph = [
    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
