  this is a picture model written in javascript.

  goal 
  accurately denote a picture using a line drawn across a graph (label the line) (convert the line to a unique point and comare how easy it is to compare incoming targets)

  why? turning a picture into a unique line is easier to compare than the picture itself which cant be done unless converted. 

  let graph = [
    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
  ];

  let picture = 'path-to-image.jpg'; 

  let x = 0; 
  let pixel_location_differential = 2;

  for(let i = 0; i  picture.length; i++) {
    
  }
    
  }
