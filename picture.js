this is a picture model written in javascript. there are three versions. one with a line. one with a point. one with a line converted to a point. all displayed.

  order 
  1. point -- this will display a unique point via an added unique number
  2. line -- this will display a unique line along the x axis <--- each feature denoted with a unique number defines the uniqueness of the point then line 
  3. line to point -- algorithm to convert an incoming line, to a point (xi * yi + ...n) 

  proof 
  can lines be converted back to points affectively (uniquely)?
  assumption: yes

  how
  using the line-point algorithm

  1. point - this is taking a picture and plotting it on a single axis
